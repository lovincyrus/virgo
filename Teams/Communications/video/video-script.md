# Virgo video script

We are surrounded by fire.

When you follow the news, you find that there is little hope for our future.

We are dealing with a set of unfolding tragedies: a deteriorating environment, a rapidly warming climate, and an economy on the verge of implosion.

The racket of war, for oil and power, is already disintegrating international treaties. In the greatest superpowers, we see an acceptance of darkness, of unaccountability, and decay into tyranny.

The systems we have inherited and co-created have become unsustainable.

Capitalism is the most magnificent fire that is engulfing this planet today. Those with the ability to accumulate capital beget even more capital at an exponential rate.

While capitalism may appear to be n unstoppable force, the fact of the matter is, capital and private property are constructs of our collective hallucination. It does not need to be this way. Our minds are open and powerful enough to consider different ways of being.

We must each use our voices, and sing out loud with thunder that pierces through the fabric of this constructed hallucination and change the tune of our reality, for the progression of this song called humanity.

We need to rethink the way we consider borders and citizenship, for all people are citizens of this world, under no authority, and with no preconceived notion of nations.

We need to commit to core values of transparency, accountability, democracy, equality, and environmental stewardship.

If we organize these communities into decentralized autonomous organizations, then from the votes of the people, the right communities will emerge and prosper.

When the software that powers our communications are free, with privacy by default, and there exists not one monopoly but a vast federation of interoperable networks.

When we build our devices on open designs, allowing anyone to manufacture them and verify their security. 

When our tools are optimized for reuse and waste reduction instead of profit and planned obsolescence.

When our social services are not held hostage by ineffective executives, but instead, we rebuild them as a network of DAOs; any majority will be able to vote for change.

When we can trust our institutions and public agencies by virtue of their transparency and accountability.

When our internet infrastructure becomes open and resilient, and censorship becomes impossible due to the nature of incentivized networks owned by local communities.

When we redesign the financial system to heal the people and the planet, rather than incentivize exploitation.

When we no longer need to spend our time accounting for our taxes, but instead we control how they are used, through a transparent and auditable model.

When these new systems work together to heal the planet and build a greater community bound by love, not hate and fear.

When all the people on earth feel that their voices matter, enabling human coordination at any scale, united under a common mission.

Let's fix the world together. Join us at Virgo.
