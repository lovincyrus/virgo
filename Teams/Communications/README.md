## Virgo Communications

Welcome to Virgo Communications! This DAO is focused on promoting Virgo and the UDV to the world at large.

## Mission

The mission of the Virgo Communications DAO is to spread the word of Virgo across the world. To inform, to captivate, and to engage the world's disenfranchised people to get together to build a sustainable future.

We will work in these areas:

* Social Media: we will manage Virgo's social media channels, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and more.
* Video: We will work together and with third party agenices to produce videos that further the Virgo cause.
* Text: We will produce written works for Virgo. These we will write ourselves, engage with volunteers to write, or hire contractors to write.
* Visual: We will collaborate to design and illustrate graphical and visual content for Virgo.
* Brand: We will create and maintain an effective brand strategy for Virgo and the UDV.
